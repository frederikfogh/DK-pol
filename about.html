        As part of an effort by Facebook to be more transparent about the political ads they were showing,
        they created
        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/">the Facebook Ad Library</a>,
        a website where you can view information about all political ads Facebook shows in certain countries
        (e.g. which organisation is and how much an organisation spend on ads).

        Their website is great for finding information about a single organisation or ad. However it lacks (in my
        opinion) the ability to compare different organisations.
        That is why I created this website, to compare statistics about political Facebook ads that are bought and
        created by Dutch political parties.
    </p>

    <h4>What specific data did you use?</h4>
    <p>The data-processing consists of two steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Retrieving the data from Facebook.</li>
        <li>Analyzing the data into a format that can be used in the charts on this website.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>For step 1, I use the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/api/">the Facebook Ad Library API</a>,
        which allows anyone to programmatically request data from the the Facebook Ad Library.

        For each party, I request the data of specific Facebook pages (Facebook ads are always connected to Facebook
        page). The Facebook pages I used can be found <a
                href="https://github.com/joren485/DutchPoliticalFacebookAdComparision/blob/master/data/facebook_page_ids.csv">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>In step 2, all ads from before 2020 are removed and the data is added up for each date and in total.

        All data is estimated based on averages, because Facebook does not return exact numbers.
        For example, Facebook does not say how much is spent on a single ad, instead they provide a range of a lower and
        an upper bound (e.g. €1000 to €1999). I use the average of the lower and upper bound.
        This means that single data points are not that interesting (e.g. it is quite a difference if you spend a €1000
        or €1999 on a single ad and taking the average does not tell you much).
        However, when compared over time or compared to other parties, it does become interesting because trends present
        themselves.

        Averaging also removes any potential spikes in the data (e.g. 90% of the views of an ad where on a single day) and spreads it evenly over the runtime of the ad.
    </p>


    <h4>Is publishing this legal?</h4>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/api/">Facebook says</a>:
        "Processed data or data that is analyzed as part of your research can be published and shared publicly."
    </p>

    <h4>Why is party X missing?</h4>
    <p>If there is a (new) party with a significant Facebook ad presence, please let me know by
        <a href="https://github.com/joren485/DutchPoliticalFacebookAdComparision/issues/new">opening an issue on
            GitHub</a></p>


    <h4>I found an issue in the website and/or the data! / I have a great idea of a graph to add!</h4>
